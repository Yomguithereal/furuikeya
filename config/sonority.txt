# !0.9.9
# Please, do not change the line above.
# Sylli configuration file. It is made of two sections:
# [General] Contains general options on Syllabification
# [Sonorities] Specifies the vocabulary (inventory and translation)
# You can comment off any line by starting a line with a hash #

[General]
# Allow extrasyllabic consonants as in 's.tra.da'
# If set to 0 the same output will return 'stra.da'
# in other words, it will ban consonantal nuclei.
extra = 1

# Default output form. Possible values are
# str: returns the string as segments.(input=output)
# cvg: converts the segments into their natural class,
# (S=stop, V=vowel, G=glide, etc).
# cvcv: converts the segments into C(onsonant) or V(owel).
# For example str: ka.sa; cvg: OV.FV cvcv: CV.CV
output = str

[Segments]
# Before the syllabification takes place,
# a transducer will convert the input into phonological
# objects. This section specifies the vocabulary to use for the
# translation, in the form X = z, w, y, where:
# X is the input form, the one to find in the string to syllabify
# z is the phonological segment, the one will be printed
# w is the sonority used by the syllabification algorithm
# y is the phonological class (printed if output = cvg is chosen)
# You may add, remove or edit any segment to adapt it to
# your alphabet or language. For example, if want to
# add a central /i/ to the vowel inventory
# you can write something like:
# I = I, 22, V

# Vowels
